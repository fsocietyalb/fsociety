Welcome, hacker.  

You’ve been chosen. A secret waits for those who dig, pry, and decode.  
The first one to find it wins. But beware: nothing is obvious.

##  Challenge Overview

A file has been hidden. A secret lies inside.  
Somewhere, embedded, encrypted, disguised.  

Your only allies: curiosity and persistence.

##  Tools You Might Need

- A mind that questions everything.  
- Terminal skills, or whatever hacking toolbox you prefer.

##  Clues (or not)

- Not all is what it seems.  
- Examine everything: names, pixels, odd strings, silent signals.  
- The password exists. You will know it when you see it.  
- Every layer has a purpose. Every byte tells a story.
